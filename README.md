### Matlab code I wrote to segregate lung cancer stage IV drug-naive patients in Rotterdam and Enschede, NL from healthy urinary microRNA samples (the divergence implementation is by Tsachy Weissman lab) and patients of Gregory Sahagian, MD (at the Neurology Center of Southern California) with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease from healthy controls based on transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper; also identified transcriptomics markers for differences between Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease

### R code I wrote for clustering (the clustering is by FactoMineR, there is also a function for clustering and differential expression analysis from the Thomas Tuschl lab, an additional function for differential expression analysis, support vector machine and random forest classification is by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn) of urinary microRNA, transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and dose response analysis, to quantify drug efficacy and the side effects, baased on targeted sequencing of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells
